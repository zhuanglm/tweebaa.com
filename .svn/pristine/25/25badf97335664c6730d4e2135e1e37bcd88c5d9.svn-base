               <h4>How to GET CASH</h4>
            <p>The easiest way to earn cash at Tweebaa is simply to share great products with your friends.  If you share a product…maybe it’s on your Facebook account… and 1 or 10 or 20 of your friends click on your shared link and buy, then you will earn up to 10% on each of those purchases!</p>
            <p>Each Tweebaa product listing has a “Share” button.  Just click that button then choose HOW you want to share (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, email).  Type in your message and “send”.  So EASY! </p>
             <p>You can also earn cash by suggesting and evaluating products.  Please see our EDUCATION pages for more details</p>
 
 <h4>How to REDEEM CASH</h4>
 
 <ul > 
 <li>Commissions are earned in TweeBucks and redeemable for cash!  (One TweeBuck = One US Dollar)</li> 
 <li>As you accrue TweeBucks, they will be deposited into your Tweebaa account.  </li> 
 <li>All commissions are computed from Tweebaa selling price less any applied discounts, and exclude any shipping fees and/or taxes.</li> 
 <li>TweeBucks earned by a product Suggester, Evaluators and Sharers will be added to those members’ accounts at the completion of purchase transactions.  The TweeBucks will be listed as “pending status” until product has shipped to the customer and the return period has expired.  At that time, “pending” TweeBucks will be transferred to “available” status and can be redeemed for CASH or purchase credits.  (TweeBucks cannot be redeemed while in pending status).</li> 
 <li>You can let your TweeBucks build like a savings account…save them up and redeem for a special occasion like birthday gifts…or for a special event like a vacation.  You can also redeem TweeBucks just like cash on purchases from Tweebaa. 
</li> 

</ul>
