                </li>
                <li>Commission percentages are directly tied to your Zone reward points in each zone.
                    The more points you accumulate in the Submit Zone, Evaluate Zone and Share Zone,
                    the higher your reward! See <a href="#" class="blue">Commission Chart</a> for levels
                    and percentages.<br />
                    · Commissions are earned in TweeBucks and redeemable for cash! (One TweeBuck = One
                    US Dollar)<br />
                    · As you accrue TweeBucks, they will be deposited into your <a href="#" class="blue">
                        Tweebaa account.</a>
                    <br />
                    · All commissions are computed from Tweebaa selling price less any applied discounts,
                    and exclude any shipping fees and/or taxes.<br />
                    · TweeBucks earned by a product Submitter, Evaluators and Sharers will be added
                    to those members’ accounts at the completion of purchase transactions. The TweeBucks
                    will be listed as “pending status” until product has shipped to the customer and
                    the return period has expired. At that time, “pending” TweeBucks will be transferred
                    to “available” status and can be redeemed for CASH or purchase credits. (TweeBucks
                    cannot be redeemed while in pending status).<br />
                    · You can let your TweeBucks build like a savings account…save them up and redeem
                    for a special occasion like birthday gifts…or for a special event like a vacation.
                    You can also redeem TweeBucks just like cash on purchases from Tweebaa.<br />
                    · As long as you log on to your Tweebaa account at least once every 18 months, TweeBucks
                    will never expire.

                            and wish to redeem them for cash, PayPal is the means by which we will send your
                            payment.
                            <br />
                            · If you do not provide a PayPal account, you can still redeem your TweeBUCKS towards

Several months later Product E is “Tweebaa-Approved” and is added to the Tweebaa Shop.

                    <strong>March 6: </strong>Charlie shares Product D with his Twitter followers; he
                    is Share Zone Level 2. Twelve friends purchase Product D from Charlie’s shared link.
                    Friends also purchase three more units of Product A from the link Charlie previously
                    shared on Facebook. All these purchases occur while Charlie is at Share Zone Level
                    2, so he receives commission of 5.5%.<br />
                    <em>Charlie is thrilled by how easy and fun it is to be a Tweebaa Sharer, and he continues
                        to share more products on Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest. With every click and/or
                        purchase, he is earning more Share points and on April 18 he advances to Share Zone
                        Level 3. Charlie’s commissions rise to 6%. </em>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Through the end of April, </strong>there are a total of 25 additional products
                    ordered through links that Charlie has previously posted on his social media networks.
                    As a Level 3, Charlie earns a 6% commission on all those 25 purchases (without doing
                    any additional work). HOORAY CHARLIE!<em> Charlie is earning lucrative commissions with
                        very little work…and he’s having great fun!</em> </li>
