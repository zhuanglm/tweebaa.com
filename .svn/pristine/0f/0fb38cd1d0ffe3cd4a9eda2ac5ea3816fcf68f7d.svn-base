<li class="p3">Browse the Tweebaa Shop. Find cool products and great prices.<br /><br />
<span class="black"><strong>COOL PRODUCTS.</strong></span><br />
Tweebaa products come from Tweebaa members.  Members (like YOU) can VOTE on products that you want to see in our store (see <a href="#"> Evaluate Zone</a>).  Once a product receives enough votes to advance to the Test-Sale stage, it is offered in limited quantity as a further test.  If enough shoppers purchase, the product is a WINNER and advances to the Tweebaa Shop.  YAY!  A new product is born!  Shop at Tweebaa and you'll be on the cutting edge of new products.<br /><br />

<span class="black"><strong>GREAT PRICES.</strong></span><br />
At Tweebaa, our products are offered direct from the manufacturers... to you.  We eliminate the extra costs that other "middlemen" (like retailers) add. <br /><br />

<span class="black"><strong>SHARE & EARN.</strong></span><br />
Perhaps the most exciting part of shopping on Tweebaa is sharing great products with your friends and earning income.  It may seem like a dream-come-true to shop and earn money at the same time!  Click here to learn more about earning money in our <a href="#">Share Zone.</a><br /><br />

<span class="black"><strong>TEAM TWEEBAA.</strong></span><br />
Don’t forget that Tweebaa members benefit whenever a sale is made.  Submitters, Evaluators, and Sharers (that’s You!) earn income on every purchase from the Tweebaa Shop.  Everybody Earns at Tweebaa!  <br /><br />

<dd class="dpn">
<li class="p3">If you want to have a sneak-peek at brand new Tweebaa items, check out the “Limited-Time” products in the Tweebaa Shop.</li>

<li class="p3">Test-Sale items only have 60 days to meet a pre-set sales quota.  Each unit purchased is a step closer to reaching quota and will help determine if the item is a "Pass" (and is added to the Tweebaa Shop).   <br /></li>
<li class="p3 clearfix"><span style="width:45%; float:left;"><img src="../Images/shop-edu1.png" width="444" height="576"></span>
<span style="width:55%; float:left;"><span class="black"><br /><strong>TEST-SALE “PASSED” = Tweebaa Approved</strong></span><br /><br />
If the Test-Sale quota is met in the designated time frame (60 days), the test sale is a PASS and all the test-sale orders are ON (test-sale orders will be shipped; ship time may extend 30-60 days after the Test-Sale goal is reached).  Tweebaa will notify buyers as soon as the 60-day time frame is over, and if Test-Sale is “Pass”, we will provide an approximate ship date.
<br /><br />
  <span class="p17"><strong>TIPS:</strong> As a Tweebaa member, you can support Test-Sale items that you like by SHARING them with your friends.  And remember, if you share and your friends purchase Tweebaa products from your shared link, you can also earn rewards!  (Learn more about <a href="#"> Share Zone.</a>)</span><br /><br />
  
  After a Test-Sale item reaches the quota, it may take 30-60 days to bring inventory to Tweebaa.  During this delayed period, <span class="red">we will continue taking orders and honor the limited-time Test-Sale pricing.</span><br /><br />
  
  <span class="black"><br /><strong>
TEST-SALE “FAILED”
</strong></span><br /><br />If the Test-Sale quota is NOT met in the designated time, the test sale is a FAIL and all test-sale orders will be cancelled.  <span class="red">Buyers will receive full refunds of the purchase price. </span> Tweebaa will notify buyers as soon as the 60-day time frame is over.<br />
If you order an item while it is in the Test-Sale stage, you may cancel the order at any time, for any reason.  (For further details on how to cancel an order, see <a href="#">link to below info “Cancellation Policy”</a>).  Keep in mind: a canceled order is a canceled vote in support of the item.
