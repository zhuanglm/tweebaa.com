                they list your email address (the one associated with your Tweebaa account) in the
                registration form. They’ll have to select that they were referred by “Friend” and
                put your email in the available box.
                <br />
                <br />
                2 – When you share Tweebaa products with your friends (via “Share & Earn” link),
                and your friend follows your link to the Tweebaa website and registers for membership…as
                long as their Tweebaa visit originated with your Share & Earn link you will be automatically
                credited with the referral.
